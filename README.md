# Oil-Well-Decline-Arps-Model-Approach
This program reads well header data and production logs (exported from Drilling Info as .csv files) and walks the user through the generation of decline curves for each well provided in the input data. Decline curves are fit with a hyperbolic curve that is estimated using an iterative least squares method.
